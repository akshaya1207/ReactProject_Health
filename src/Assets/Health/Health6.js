      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Understanding High Triglycerides (Hypertriglyceridemia)</h2>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>High triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia) is a very common condition that increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, poor circulation, and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). It's most often caused by lifestyle factors, including poor diet, excessive alcohol, and not enough exercise. High triglycerides can also be caused by certain medications or genetic conditions.</p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>By living a healthy lifestyle, a person can help keep their triglyceride level (TG level) at an optimal value and lower the risk of developing medical complications.</p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>We all need some triglycerides (TG) for our bodies to function in a normal, healthy way, but having too much TG can be harmful to our health. Triglyceride particles are a type of fat particle in the blood. Each TG is made up of three molecules of fat attached to one molecule of glycerol. Our body uses TG for purposes such as energy storage, energy transportation and fuel for metabolism.</p>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>Dietary Changes to Lower Triglycerides</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Dietary changes do help lower a person’s triglyceride levels. The main food ingredients that lead to high TG levels are simple carbohydrates (starches), sugars, alcohol (ethanol), and saturated fats. The path to getting healthier or staying healthy includes eating less of the preceding four ingredients, and selecting “better” types of carbohydrates, sweeteners, or fats when dining or shopping for groceries.</p>
      
      <h4 style={heading4Style}>Healthier Food Choices Include:</h4>
      <ul style={listStyle}>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Water or sugar-free diet drinks, such as those with sucralose, aspartame, stevia, acesulfame, etc. — instead of regular soda pop or other sugary drinks.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Tea or coffee without sugar — instead of beer, wine or cocktails.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Low-sugar cow milk that is also low-fat or fat-free, such as Fairlife cow milk which has 50% less sugar than most of the other cow milks in grocery stores.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Fresh fruit with no added sugar — instead of cookies, candy bars, cakes, pastries, canned fruit or juice.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Leafy vegetables — instead of starchy vegetables.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Whole grain or whole wheat bread — instead of white bread.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Brown rice or whole wheat pasta — instead of white rice or regular pasta.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Spreads with no added sugar — instead of sugary jams or jellies.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Whole wheat crackers with no added sugar — instead of plain saltine crackers.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Low-fat or fat-free foods — instead of foods with animal fats, butter, cream, palm oil, or coconut oil.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Fish and other sources of omega-3 fatty acids — instead of red meat.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>Lifestyle Changes to Lower Triglycerides</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Doctors often advise patients to:</p>
      <ul style={listStyle}>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. Don’t skip meals.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Avoid late-night snacking or eating after dinner has finished.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Exercise regularly and look for exercises that are enjoyable.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Walk more steps during one’s daily routine. Use a cellphone’s step counter to help walk or run 6,000 to 10,000 steps each day.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Be sure to get into the habit of reading food labels when shopping online or in stores. Many foods contain types of sugar that have names that don't include the word “sugar.” Decrease or avoid foods that have any of the following words in the first few ingredients on their labels, because these ingredients are sugars:</li>
        <ul style={listStyle}>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Sucrose</li>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Glucose</li>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Fructose</li>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Corn syrup</li>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Maltose</li>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Honey</li>
          <li style={listItemStyle}>Molasses</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>Understanding Triglyceride Levels</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>A person with too many triglycerides in their blood is diagnosed with the condition hypertriglyceridemia. Ideally, keeping TG below 100 mg/dL is optimal for reducing one’s health risks, but 100–150 mg/dL is still in the “normal” range. A goal doctors often have is to help patients get their TG levels to less than 150 mg/dL. A mildly high TG of 150 to 199 mg/dL is usually cared for with diet and lifestyle improvements. A high level of 200 to 499 mg/dL needs additional medical evaluation.</p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Scientists continue to do research on how hypertriglyceridemia leads to the gradual formation of plaque in arteries. With high TG levels, the body’s processing of TG particles seems to result in cholesterol particles such as LDL cholesterol (also known as “bad” cholesterol) creating inflammation and fatty build-up in arteries, thus leading to more heart disease, poor circulation due to narrowed blood vessels, or strokes.</p>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>Patience is Key</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Health changes take time, so be patient. If you’ve made changes to what you eat in your daily diet, your triglyceride and other cholesterol levels will improve over time.</p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Be patient and give your body time to adjust to your new nutritional habits.</p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Meanwhile, be sure to get some exercise as a daily routine.</p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>Ask your provider how long it may take to see changes and when you should recheck your lipid panel lab test. This can be done by scheduling a video appointment with a HealthTap primary care doctor.</p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>A standard lipid panel checks levels of triglycerides (TG), “bad” cholesterol (LDL) and “good” cholesterol (HDL). All three result numbers are important.</p>
