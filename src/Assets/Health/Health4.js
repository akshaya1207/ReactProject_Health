      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Understanding Seasonal Depression (SAD)</h2>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Depression doesn’t always exist at the same level all year round (or even daily). While some people deal with some amount of depressive symptoms every day, others find they occur only on a seasonal basis — usually during the late fall and early winter (although it can happen at any time).
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        This condition is known as seasonal depression (also known as seasonal affective disorder or SAD), and it is thought to impact approximately five percent of people in the United States — although up to 20 percent of Americans complain about the “winter blues” without ever getting an official diagnosis.
      </p>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>Why Does Seasonal Depression Happen?</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Unlike major depression, outside factors like weather conditions (like the temperature or the time the sun rises and sets) play a prominent role.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Although researchers have yet to isolate the “cause” of seasonal depression, most believe the primary trigger is a shorter photoperiod — the amount of time between when the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening. The popular theory is that this change in active daylight hours disrupts the release of melatonin, a natural hormone that helps promote sleep.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Why is melatonin important? The release of melatonin is an essential part of the circadian rhythm, also referred to as the body’s “internal clock.” The circadian rhythm is the driving force between the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle, impacting when the body wants to sleep and when it is ready to be awake.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        In addition, when there are fewer hours of sunlight during the day, some believe the brain naturally produces less serotonin (a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, among other functions). Lower levels of serotonin are one of the contributing factors for many types of depression — not just seasonal depression but bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder as well.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        The same goes for vitamin D, an essential vitamin synthesized in the body when the skin is exposed to the sun. Besides helping improve mood, vitamin D is also crucial for helping absorb calcium and maintain bone health and strength.
      </p>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>Symptoms of Seasonal Depression</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Although everyone experiences the symptoms of depression differently, a few common signs and symptoms are characteristic of SAD. These include:
      </p>
      <ul style={listStyle}>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>A change in sleep patterns (often sleeping more than usual).</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Difficulty concentrating.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Feeling down.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Heaviness in the arms and/or legs.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Increased cravings for carbohydrate-heavy foods.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Loss of interest and motivation in life.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Low energy.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Negative thoughts.</li>
        
      </ul>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        People who experience the other, less common seasonal form of depression, summer depression (instead of winter depression), may have slightly different symptoms, including:
      </p>
      <ul style={listStyle}>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Decreased appetite.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Difficulty sleeping.</li>
        <li style={listItemStyle}>Weight loss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Most of the symptoms of seasonal depression correlate directly to how the body adjusts to changes in its sleep-wake cycle and the amount of natural sunlight it can soak up — too little makes people overly tired, while too much makes them struggle to get enough sleep.
      </p>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>What to Do About Seasonal Depression</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Even though seasonal depression often resolves on its own once the weather gets warmer, there are ways to reduce its severity.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        The best place to start is speaking with a doctor knowledgeable about mental health concerns. Trained professionals, like those at HealthTap, are experienced in developing an individualized treatment plan to help manage the symptoms of SAD — with pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        For patients who want to pursue medication to treat their seasonal depressive episodes, options usually include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and bupropion (generic Wellbutrin) to help increase serotonin levels.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        In addition, antidepressant medications tend to work even better when combined with non-pharmacological methods. Over-the-counter vitamin D supplements can also help if recommended by a medical professional.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        A good example of a non-pharmacological way to manage seasonal depression is a lightbox. When used for 30 minutes first thing in the morning, a light box mimics the bright light of the sun as it comes up, helping to trick the body into the same circadian rhythm it’s used to in warmer weather.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        However, it’s a common misunderstanding that light therapy can help increase vitamin D levels — doing that requires UV light (as well as supplementation), and lightboxes only emit safer, non-UV light.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Some people also find talk therapy beneficial, especially cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps patients modify their thoughts and behaviors for a more positive outlook.
      </p>
      
      <h3 style={subheadingStyle}>How to Prevent Seasonal Depression</h3>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Besides taking an antidepressant year-round, are there ways to stop seasonal depression before it has a chance to take hold?
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        For many people, consistency is key. Developing a healthy routine that is easy to stick to, whether it's the early summer, winter months, or spring, can help reduce the impact the changing weather can have on the body.
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        For example, focusing on a healthy diet can prevent overeating, and regular exercise can release endorphins to keep the mood elevated and counteract lower energy levels (especially if done outside, even in the cold).
      </p>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        It can also help to plan to continue being social, even when the temperatures plummet. Social withdrawal can also lead to depressive symptoms, so planning to spend time with friends and family can help reduce feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, which is one of the side effects of these seasonal changes and periods of less sunlight. Social interaction can make a big difference in outlook.
